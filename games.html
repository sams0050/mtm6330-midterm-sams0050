        <p class="card-text">Similar to previous titles, Double Dash!! challenges Mario series player characters to
          race against each other on Mario-themed tracks. The game introduced a number of new gameplay features, such
          as supporting co-op gameplay with two riders per kart. One player drives the kart, and the other uses items.
          Players can switch at any time. Double Dash!! is the only game in the Mario Kart series to allow cooperative
          gameplay so far. Double Dash!! supports LAN play using the Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter, allowing up
          to 16 players to compete simultaneously. There are 20 characters to select from in total, each of which with
          a special item, and with eleven characters being new to the series.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The game features five single-player game modes: Grand Prix, Time Trial, Versus, Battle,
          and Mission. The Grand Prix and Vs modes require that the player choose an engine class from among 50 cc, 100
          cc, and 150 cc. The classes serve as difficulty levelsâ€”the higher the engine class, the faster all karts go.
          In addition, a Mirror mode can be unlocked, in which karts use 150 cc engines and tracks are horizontally
          reversed (including signs and lettering present in the original orientation).</p>

          four person split screen. Online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was available at launch, but was
          discontinued in May 2014, along with other Wii and Nintendo DS games that supported online play.[2] Many fans
          have created alternative servers to continue playing on, one of the more notable being Wiimmfi.</p>
