      <h1>History Of Mario Kart</h1>
      <p>When you think about, it really sounds like a stupid idea for a game.</p>
      <p>I mean, what was Nintendo thinking? “Let’s just put all of the Mario characters in little karts and have them
        race and throw banana peels at each other.” Um, OK? Is this a joke?</p>
      <p>Well, the joke’s on us. Mario Kart has become one of Nintendo’s biggest franchises, and the gaming giant has
        made sure to release a new one with every console it makes. With the upcoming Mario Kart 8 coming out on the
        Wii
        U on May 30, we thought it would be fun to look back at the series’ history.</p>

    <div class="history">
      <p>It’s hard to believe that the kart-racing genre wasn’t always around, but it really got its start with Super
        Mario Kart. The Super Nintendo classic enabled two players to race against each other as different characters
        in
        the Mario franchise on colorful courses. You could also fight your friend in Battle Mode, where each player had
        to eliminate the other by using weapons.</p>
      <p>The roster included Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Princess Peach, Bowser, Toad, Koopa Troopa,&nbsp;and Donkey Kong Jr.</p>
      <p>Super Mario Kart was one of the Super Nintendo’s most popular releases, and it helped create a new sub-genre
        of
        racing games. Instead of focusing entirely on skill, Mario Kart added items to the mix. The player could use
        homing shells, banana peels, and invincibility stars to gain an advantage. Even if you were stuck in last
        place,
        there was always hope you’d get some good items and make a big comeback. Keeping true to Nintendo’s philosophy,
        it was fun for everyone, and Super Mario Kart established one of the company’s most enduring series.</p>
